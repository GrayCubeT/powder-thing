# powder-thing
A physics simulation of a lot of particles. Works only on windows (I think)
Showcases vertex array usage and basic movement of camera view in sfml.

Controls:
ASWD/rmb - move screen  
ZX/mouse wheel - zoom screen (can go to negative numbers and flip)  
E - pull particles  
Q - stop particles  
F - spawn a "sun" - a pull at a stationary point  
lmb - spawn 1000 particles at the area of a mouse  
R - reset everything  

Mouse wheel on some of the texts changes some values.
