# powder-thing
A physics simulation of a lot of particles. Works only on windows (I think)
Showcases vertex array usage and basic movement of camera view in sfml.

Controls:
ASWD/rmb - move screen\n
ZX/mouse wheel - zoom screen (can go to negative numbers and flip)\n
E - pull particles\n
Q - stop particles\n
F - spawn a "sun" - a pull at a stationary point\n
lmb - spawn 1000 particles at the area of a mouse\n
R - reset everything\n

Mouse wheel on some of the texts changes some values.
